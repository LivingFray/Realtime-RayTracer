# Realtime-RayTracer
A RayTracer that uses Compute shaders to operate in real time
Written in C++ and GLSL (OpenGL 4).
Using a grid based ray marching algorithm to find potential intersections it is capable of rendering multiple spheres in real time,
with effects such as reflection, refraction, soft shadows, fresnel.
